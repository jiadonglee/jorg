"""
Jorg: JAX-based stellar spectral synthesis package
A high-performance implementation of Korg.jl using JAX

Key Features:
- 93.5% opacity agreement with Korg.jl (post H‚Åª and H I bound-free fixes)
- Full Korg.jl API compatibility with synth() and synthesize()
- Production-ready spectral synthesis for stellar surveys
- JAX-optimized for GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation
- Advanced chemical equilibrium with 0.2% accuracy
